  <h1>Beth Salvatore</h1>
  <h2>I'm from Minnesota but now live in Lexington.</h2>
  <p> I love rescuing animals, knitting, reading, going to punk shows
     and playing bagpipes.</p>
  <p>My West Coast friends gave me the nickname of "Demoncowgirl"
    because I moved back to North Dakota, from Los Angeles, and, as a punk
   rocker, I mostly wore black. That, and they really believed there was
 nothing in ND except buffalo, Native Americans and outhouses! They also
called my "Buffalo Soldier".</p>
