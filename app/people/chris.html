        <p>Born and raised in Richmond, KY.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2016 with a B.S. in Physics. I recently moved back to Kentucky from Madison, Wisconsin where I worked as a project manager at Epic Systems. Wanting to change careers I decided to turn my hobby of learning code into my profession.</p>
