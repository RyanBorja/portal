I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hit me with a cricket bat. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hit me with a cricket bat. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. You hit me with a cricket bat. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
